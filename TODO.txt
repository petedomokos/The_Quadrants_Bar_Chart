TODO
 now: - remove linting errors
 now: - solve the rows-cols issue, perhaps just have break points
          - soln: first work out nr of rows, by havingb a minwidth for charts. it tries to fit thdm on 1 row first.
           note this minwidth must increase for large and xlarge screens, so that height is also utilised.
          - once we know nrRows, we can adjust nr cols so theres same nr charts on each row.
          - once we have nr rows and nr cols, the chatrt sizes can be calculated as currently happens.
          - check: for small nr of charts and large space, does chart get as big as poss? it seemed to have a really big margin,
          -or is that just the extra horiz space? if so, we should add up all the extra horiz space, or extra vert space,
          and apply it to the container margin rather than each chart margin.

  now: - add data for 24 sessions

  now: README: Add intro text and diagrams to read me and also to the screen as an overlay wth a button to open/close, but auto open it 
   on first load (ie useState)
         - When a player becomes injured,the rehabilitation team identify the key measures and values that must be attained before player can be 
            signed off as fit to play/perform. These will typically be based on values of these measures for this player prior to injury.
         - The measures are looslely placed into 4 categories [eg sharpness, cv, posture, technical]
         - The worst perfoming measures in each chart are placed on the outside of each bar chart. This means that they ar eeasy to spot, and also 
         that the shape and progress towards a 'perfect square' is clear at a glance. This helps the manager becaude they can potentially look at all of their injured
         players on a screen at one time, and easily see who is close to being available, and also teh shape of thier progress to idenify concerns
         It also motivates the player, because all the have to focus on is to get back to a perfect square, which improves their psychoogical state
         as it gives a clear, achievable yet challenging task for their rehabilitatin period.

   now - remove quad chart from switchplay app and form its readme

   now - work out best way to deploy and do it. maybe turn app into my portfolio app?
   ------------------------------------
 SOON

 - add a react context and hooks

 - interactivity
   - tooltip: hover/tap bar -> shows tootlip
   - add a ctrls bar across the top below the title
   - button to remove the ordering of bars, so order is constant. in that case it orders them all based on first or latest training session.
   - button to change the nr of sessions show (ie last 20 sessions, or last x sessions, doesnt start from session 1)
   - zoom: user can zoom and pan the chart
   - click session title -> zooms in to fill screen with that session (and greys out other sessions if still in view to the sides)

 - presentation
   - add 5 different colours for the bars, which only show when a quadrant is selected. This allows user to track a particular measure.
   - if user hovers/taps a measure, the other measures become grey and reduced opacity (ie grey out). And the bar label shows (can be over the other bars) 

---------------------------------
LATER
- window resizing hook
- CSS
    - learn way to bring props into css file, instead of teh JSS stlyed components
    (or learn MUI v6 styled components or emotion, whatever is easiest / best use of my time)

- add an animation, and a run button, which replaces all charts with one large chart and tranitions through them, with 
 a timeline underneath, which is also draggable
